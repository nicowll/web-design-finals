                        Green tea, namely matcha tea, has been used in China and Japan for many years. Adding matcha powder to hot water and whisking it together produces a taste and texture that is sweeter and creamier than other teas. It has potential health advantages and may be used hot or cold. Compared to other varieties of green tea, matcha tea has higher amounts of minerals including caffeine, vitamins, and fiber.

                         The key distinguishing factor of Earl Grey tea is the addition of oil of bergamot, which is extracted from the rind of the bergamot orange (Citrus bergamia). Bergamot oranges are primarily grown in the Calabria region of Italy. The oil imparts a distinctive citrusy, floral, and slightly spicy flavor and aroma to the tea. Whether you prefer it as a morning pick-me-up or an afternoon treat, Earl Grey tea has remained a classic and beloved choice among tea enthusiasts.
